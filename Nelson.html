            Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, also known by the name Madiba, was born on July 18, 1918, in Mvezo, South Africa. He was a South African anti-apartheid activist and politician who served as the first president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country’s first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election.<br>
            Mandela studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the African National Congress (ANC) in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party’s white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, Mandela and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow.<br>
            Mandela was appointed president of the ANC’s Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He spent over 20 years in prison for his opposition to the apartheid regime and was released in 1990. In 1994, Mandela was later elected the first leader of a democratic South Africa.<br><br>
            His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.<br>
            Mandela passed away on December 5, 2013, in Johannesburg, leaving behind an enduring legacy of peace and social justice.<br><br>

Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in Mvezo, South Africa. He was the son of Chief Henry Mandela of the Madiba clan of the Xhosa-speaking Tembu people. After his father’s death, young Nelson was raised by Jongintaba, the regent of the Tembu. Mandela renounced his claim to the chieftainship to become a lawyer.<br>Mandela’s early life was dominated by traditional Xhosa custom and taboo. He grew up with two sisters in his mother’s kraal in the village of Qunu, where he tended herds as a cattle-boy and spent much time outside with other boys. As a boy, Mandela grew up in the company of tribal elders and chiefs, which gave him a rich sense of African self-government and heritage.<br>

<br>Nelson Mandela had a rich personal life. He was married three times and fathered six children.<br>
<b>Evelyn Ntoko Mase:</b> His first marriage was to Evelyn Ntoko Mase, who, like Mandela, was also from what later became South Africa’s Transkei region. They met in Johannesburg.<br>
<b>Winnie Madikizela:</b> Mandela met Winnie and they got married on June 24, 1958. She became involved in ANC activities and spent many weeks in prison. They had their first daughter, Zenani, in February 1959 and their second daughter, Zindziswa, in December 19603. They got a divorce in March 1996 due to political estrangement.<br>
<b>Graça Machel:</b> Mandela’s third marriage was to Graça Machel.<br>
As a husband and a father, Mandela sacrificed the joys of family life and of seeing his children grow up. Despite his political commitments, he valued his family and often spoke about the pain of being away from them during his years in prison.
