    Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario1. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor’s degrees in economics and physics there1. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software company Zip21.<br><br>
    The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank1. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal1. In 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company1. In 2004, he became an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.).<br><br>
Musk is the founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, product architect and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation1. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$207 billion as of October 2023, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $231 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.<br>

      Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, in 1971. He felt like an outsider growing up in South Africa, as he was a quiet, nerdy child. He spent most of his time reading, even consuming encyclopedias after he’d read all of the books at local libraries.<br><br>        Because of his photographic memory, he remembered specific facts and could accurately recite them.
Musk also experienced difficulties in his early life, including being bullied and struggling with the divorce of his parents. Despite these challenges, he grew up with the freedom and resources to explore his interests.<br><br> 
     At the age of 18, Musk immigrated to Canada, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario.<br> He later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor’s degrees in economics and physics.
