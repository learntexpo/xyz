            <i>       Albert Einstein</i> was a German physicist of the 19th and 20th centuries, <i>born on March 14, 1879</i>, 
            and <i>passed away on April 18, 1955</i>. He revolutionized our understanding of the universe with his theory of relativity.
                    Einstein was born in the<b> German city of Ulm</b>, but his family moved to Munich when he was one year old. <br><br>
                    At the age of 17, he entered the<u> Federal Polytechnic School of Zurich</u> to study <b>mathematics and physics.</b>
                     After graduation, he obtained Swiss citizenship and began working at the Federal Office of Intellectual Property in 
                     Switzerland.<br><br>
                    1905 was a pivotal year for Einstein. He published four scientific articles on <i>the photoelectric effect, Brownian
                         motion, the theory of special relativity, and mass-energy equivalence (E = mc²)</i>. The <i>first earned him the 
                            <b>Nobel Prize in Physics</b> in 1921</i>.<br><br>
                    In 1908, he began teaching physics at the University of Bern, later moving to Prague and finally Berlin. The rise of the Nazi 
                    regime forced him to leave Germany and move to the United States in 19321. There he taught at the Institute for Advanced Study 
                    in Princeton and became an American citizen.<br><br>
                   Einstein spent the rest of his life trying to<i> integrate the physical laws of gravity and electromagnetism</i>. He also 
                   <b>advocated</b> for <u>pacifist, socialist, and Zionist values</u>. He passed away as a result of an internal hemorrhage on
                     April 18, 1955.

            Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany. He was born to Jewish parents.
            <br> His father, Hermann Einstein, was a salesman and engineer who, with his brother, founded Electrotechnics Fabrik J.
             Einstein & Cie, a Munich-based company that mass-produced electrical equipment.<br><br>
            Einstein did not excel in school, but he developed a keen interest in mathematics and science2. At the age of seventeen, in 1897, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich1. After graduating in 1900, he worked in a government office while continuing to study physics on his own.

	     Albert Einstein made several significant contributions to the world of science. Here are some of his major accomplishments:<br><br>
1. <b>Empirical Evidence for the Atomic Theory</b>: Einstein provided empirical evidence for the atomic theory through his explanation of Brownian motion.<br><br>
2. <b>Determination of Avogadro’s Number</b>: He enabled the determination of Avogadro’s number and therefore the size of molecules.<br><br>
3. <b>Solution to the Photoelectric Effect</b>: Einstein solved the riddle of the photoelectric effect, which couldn’t be explained with Maxwell’s wave theory of light.<br><br>
4. <b>Special Theory of Relativity</b>: He proposed the special theory of relativity, which brought major changes to mechanics while handling situations close to the speed of light.<br><br>
These accomplishments laid the foundation for modern physics and changed our understanding of space, time, mass, and energy.<br><br><br>

         Albert Einstein’s personal life was as complex as his scientific theories. He was married twice, first to Mileva Marić in 1903, with whom he had a daughter and two sons. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1919. In the same year, he married his cousin Elsa Löwenthal, who passed away in 1936.<br>
         Einstein was known to have had affairs and received gifts from women, which caused some turmoil in his marriages. Despite his intellectual prowess, Einstein lived much of his life in intellectual solitude. For relaxation, music played a significant role in his life.<br><br><br>

         Albert Einstein's life and thought left an impact not only on science, but also on philosophy, visual art, and literature. Although he is best remembered for his extraordinary contributions to modern physics, his theory of relativity had perhaps the farthest-reaching implications for thinkers in all fields.<br>        Einstein's work laid the foundation for much of the research into the evolution of the universe as well as modern technology, including lasers and computer chips. His enduring legacy will continue to inspire generations of great thinkers.
